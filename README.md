📁 Salem's TikTok-Inspired Portfolio
This is my final project for Communications Lab – a personal portfolio designed in a TikTok-style layout. It’s clean, interactive, and mobile-friendly. The page includes links to all four of my class assignments and reflects my design style and technical learning.
